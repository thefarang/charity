  We need to correctly create the inputs

  Where should javascript be included?

  We need to incorporate jquery
    Initially just pull down from internet directly
    Then incorporate into codebase later
  We need to disable submit on click
  We need to capture the submit, and ajax send to login-auth
  We need to display error message on failure to authenticate
  We need to hide error message on interaction with form elements
  We need to store token returned on correct authentication
  We need to redirect to /dashboard on authentication
  We need to organise views into pages/ and partials/ and reuse items accordingly
  We need to add the miner check
